Ensemblisms is professional hack time in podcast format. The information shared on this site is a public service to those interested in, or those who are already developing on Intersystems technologies. 

Podcasting is an extremely valuable format. It enables a "show not tell" learning platform in a strict 10 minutes or less. The show notes supply downloadable sources so that audience can also interact with or learn by example. 

The venue is open. The subject matter can be fun, but powerful when applied in real world Ensemble productions. Want to hook up Ensemble to Twitter? Want to remote control a giant robot with Zen app? We can do that here... 

Ensemblisms compliments Educational resources supplied by Intersystems and the Google Groups, but does not compete to replace it. 

Ensemblisms is NOT an Intersystems venture, it is a product of the using community of their products in West Michigan. Please review the disclaimer for further details.
